# Zoo D’ Nirvana POS System
Password: zooadmin

# Project Background
After a few discussions, we decided to create a zoo point-of-sale system called Zoo D’ Nirvana System for this project. The main purpose of creating this program is to make the business operation of the zoo more efficient.
In this age of globalization, we need a program that can make all the manual works automated to make things faster and more accurate. This program can replace the old-school way of buying the ticket which is at the cash register. The visitor needs to make quick-decision because there is a long line waiting behind them.
Besides, the detailed information about the zoo’s packages, different prices and benefit of the add-on activities chosen are easier for the visitor to accessed instead of looking at a brochure or board that usually has limited information. They always need to ask the cashier more about the packages so this kind of way costs much times.
By implementing this program, we hope that it will make the buying experience easier both for the cashier and the customer.

# Project Scope
This program can be used by the visitor by self-servicing through online website or ticket machine that will print the official receipt. Then, they need to pass the receipt to the counter to redeem their entrance ticket.
It also can be used by the cashier to calculate the customer’s package and add-on activities. Hence, this program comes with 2 modes, one for the visitor to select package and buy. The other one is secured staff mode with password needed for the worker or sales manager to see the total sales, number of visitor in a day, demand for each activity and many other useful statistics for business purpose. Besides, only through staff mode the system can be closed, else it will just keep repeating for the next customer.

# Conclusion
This program has make the purchase of ticket at zoo more efficient for the visitor in gaining detailed information about all the packages in the zoo instead of the old-school way of figuring out all the packages by looking at brochure or asking the cashier while a long line is standing behind. User also have way more flexibility in making decision. In this program, we put a lot of checkpoints where the user can re-input the data if they change their mind to take another offer. The implementation of this program to the zoo is crucial for nowadays fast lifestyle in saving the time of the cashier, sales manager and of course the customer. This program has daily statistics that can be accessed by the staff to see the daily sales for each category and add-on activity, total visitors, net profit and many other useful data for business purposes.
However, we hope in the future this program will be modified until it became more useful in many ways. For example, more package or activity can be added if the zoo wanted to do so. For future recommendation, more possibility of input should be considered and more data can be extracted for the statistics. Thus, we admit that our program needs more improvement especially in UI/UX. We are ready to modify it if there is any good suggestions to satisfy the user’s need for the foreseeable future.
